Subway
======

Subway is a web-based IRC client with a multi-user backend and a
JavaScript-heavy UI. Frontend/backend communication is done with
websockets (or best available fallback where not available).
The backend supports connection persistence and optional logging when the
browser disconnects.

Subway is built with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/),
[node-irc](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc)
and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) on the backend,
and [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) on the frontend.

Installation
------------

*Should be something like this, once implemented:*

1. Assuming you already have node.js, npm, and mongo, run:

        $ git clone https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway.git
        $ cd subway

2. Install the dependencies using npm:
    
    	$ npm install

3. Launch the web server

        $ node subway

4. Point your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`


Development
-----------

Discussion about the client takes place on the freenode channel **#subway**, and on
this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/issues) page.
Contributors are welcome and greatly appreciated.


History
-------

Subway is a combination of two projects that started independently
with a similar technology stack and similar aims:

- [subway-web](https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-web) /
  [subway-server](https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-server)
  by David Petersen
- [web-irc](https://github.com/akavlie/web-irc) by Aaron Kavlie

Its goals are twofold:
1) Become the best web-based IRC client available
2) Provide a really easy method of persistent IRC connections, available
   from any web browser

The inspiration for Subway was trying to watch a fellow programmer try
to explain how to set up screen/irssi to a non-technical person.
