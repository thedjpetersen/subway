Subway
======

*(Note: this is aspirational. Not implemented yet!)*

Subway is an IRC client/server combination. The server works for multiple simultaneous users, with optional persistent connections and logging. The client is a modern JavaScript-heavy web interface. Server/client communication is done with websockets (or best available fallback) via socket.io.

Subway utilizes [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and
Martyn Smith's [node-irc](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc) on the backend,
and [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) on the frontend.


Status
------

Nothing works yet. Functionality to come shortly. If you'd like to contribute,
there is plenty to do. Tickets for needed functionality also to come shortly.

Installation
------------

*Should be something like this, once implemented:*

1. Assuming you already have node.js & npm, run:

    $ npm install -g subway

2. Launch the web server

    $ node bin/subway

3. Point your browser at `http://localhost:8337/`

Development
-----------

*Should be about like this, once implemented:*

Replace step 1 above with this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway.git
    $ cd subway
    $ npm link

this should install dependencies, and link the git checkout to your global
node_modules directory.

History
-------

Subway is a combination of two projects that started independently
with a similar technology stack and similar aims:

- [subway-web](https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-web) /
  [subway-server](https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-server)
  by David Petersen
- [web-irc](https://github.com/akavlie/web-irc) by Aaron Kavlie

Its goals are twofold:
1) Become the best web-based IRC client available
2) Provide a really easy method of persistent IRC connections, available
   from any web browser
